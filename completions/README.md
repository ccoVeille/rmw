# Shell completion scripts

By default, rmw completions are installed when rmw is installed (This can be
disabled by using '-Dinstall_shell_completions' during meson setup). If they
aren't present on your system, you can install a shell completion manually by
getting the completion from the rmw source package or git repository. See the
links below for specific installation instructions for each completion.
